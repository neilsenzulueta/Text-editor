Module 19 Challenge: Progressive Web Applications(PWA)

## Description 

My task for this challenge was to build a text-editor that runs in the browser. This app will be a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. I will be working with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. The full stack application will be deployed using Render. The starter code was provided by UC Davis coding bootcamp.
